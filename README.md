# Open-Space-Layout
EEC 289Q Final Project

Created by Randall Fowler and Conor King

## Overview
This project was created to find the optimal open space layout for a given room. A discretized firefly algorithm is used to search the solution space.

## Requirements
* numpy
* sympy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* tqdm
* skimage

## Usuage
A good example to get started using this program would be to use the `testing.py` file. This file gives an example of how a room is set up, objects are listed, how to call the firefly algorithm, and see the results.

The `notes.md` file contain some solution of tested rooms and the runtimes with different parameters. It also contains a list of tasks that could be done to improve this project. Currently, it does run and move things in the room, but it doesn't guarantee all open space is accessible yet.

## Results
Some results can be seen in `notes.md`, but documentation of the project is kept within the `Paper` folder as a pdf file.

## Acknowledgements
This project was completed for EEC 289Q at UC Davis, Winter 2024, by Randall Fowler and Conor King.
